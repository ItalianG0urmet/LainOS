# Lain OS
Lain OS is my very first operating system project. This is a learning journey, and I'm exploring how far I can go with it.  
I don’t update the OS frequently because I’m taking the time to study all the necessary resources. I prefer understanding the full picture before creating something, rather than rushing into development without knowing what I’m actually doing
